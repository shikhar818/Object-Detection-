# Object Detection with SSD MobileNet V2, LabelImg, and OpenCV

Welcome to the **Image Labeling and Object Detection** repository! This project demonstrates the process of labeling images using the LabelImg tool, applying transfer learning with the *SSD MobileNet V2 FPNLite 320x320* for object detection, and implementing real-time detection using **OpenCV**.

## Introduction

This project showcases a complete workflow for labeling images and training an object detection model using transfer learning. The goal is to create a robust image detection system that can perform real-time detection using OpenCV.

We use the following key components:
- **LabelImg
